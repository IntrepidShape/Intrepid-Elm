	[Intro Music]
	
	Hello and welcome to a video introduction to the Elm programming language. 
	
	Elm is a functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript, making it a great choice for building web applications. 
	It has a focus on user experience and reliability, so you can be sure your projects will run smoothly and look great. 
	
	So what makes Elm different from other programming languages? 
	  
	One of the most important features of Elm is its strong type system. 
		This helps you catch errors early in the development process, reducing the amount of time spent debugging. Elm also has a simple and concise syntax that makes it easy to learn and understand. 
	
	The Elm architecture is another key part of the language. 
		This architecture helps you create clean and maintainable code that works well in a team environment. Elm also has a vibrant community with lots of helpful resources. There are plenty of tutorials and online courses to help you get started. 
	
	In summary, Elm is a great choice for web development. 
		It has a powerful type system, an easy to learn syntax, and an active community. So why not give Elm a try?
